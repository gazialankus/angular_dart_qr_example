## QR Code Example for Angular Dart

This is an example that uses the Dart [QR](https://pub.dev/packages/qr) library to render a simple QR code in Angular Dart. 

I had used this great library in a rush more than a year ago but the example that
came with the library was a bit too complicated for my sleepless brain to easily comprehend. 

I had managed to use it well, and used my last 10 seconds before sleep to [complain]() :) @kevmoo politely asked me to send a pull request. 
I didn't. I'm ashamed. 

Today someone else commented on my long-standing issue, which prompted me to crack my fingers and create an example. 
I initially meant this as a pull request on the library but it already has a full Angular Dart example project. 
So I thought I'd create a repo out of it, which may be useful to some in the meantime. 
 
I tried to make it into a library [here](https://github.com/gazialankus/qr.angulardart), but failed.
